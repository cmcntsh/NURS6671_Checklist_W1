# Statistical Analysis/Critique Steps

Hopefully, the statistics you calculate are more than just a collection of random facts about the data you have. Most of the time, individuals and organizations are seeking to answer a question or solve a problem using statistical data. As such, the statistics you calculate should be part of the supporting evidence of a well-crafted argument (Booth et al., 2016). Validity is an overarching concern of science and refers to the level of truth we ascribe to inferences (Shadish et al., 2002). The purpose of this checklist is to help you gather information relevant to establishing the validity of the inferences you seek to make with the statistics you calculate. The answers you provide to the prompts in this checklist are the logical foundation upon which any arguments you seek to make with the results of your analyses rest. Ensuring the integrity of your data and your analyses is part of ethical statistical practice (American Statistical Association, 2022). Background information should not be overlooked when conducting and interpreting statistical analyses. It’s never a bad idea to consult a statistician during the planning stages of a study or analysis to ensure the data collection and analysis plan is sound (Berman & Gullion, 2007). This checklist will also help you gather the needed information to work with a statistician.

| **Study Information (The Big Picture)** |
| What is the source of the data you’ve gathered? Is the mechanism by which you’ve collected your data subject to bias? The questions in this section are geared toward data collected as part of a study, but the same concepts apply when analyzing data from an existing data source. If you are extracting data from an existing data source, you might consider by what mechanisms data were collected and entered into that data source and what query was used to extract the data from the data source. Are the data collection and entry methods subject to bias? Is the wording of the query sound, or are there potential errors or omissions which might lead to some of the relevant data being excluded from the dataset used for analysis? |
| Name of the study |
| <br><br><br><br> |
| What is the general purpose of this study/analysis? (exploration, hypothesis confirmation, quality improvement, learning, other?) What are the implications for how test-wise and study-wise error rates, inferences from tests, and generalizability of results are handled? |
| <br><br><br><br> |
| What are the research questions for this study? Have the investigators hypothesized any outcomes? |
| <br><br><br><br> |
| What is the study design? (Can a specific design described in a study design text like Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Generalized Causal Inference by Shadish, Cook, and Campbell be identified (Shadish et al., 2002)?) What are the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study? What threats to validity may be applicable to this study design? Are there any procedures that can be put in place to address these threats? |

| What were IRB status and procedures? Are there any other ethical considerations necessary for this study? (American Statistical Association, 2022) |

| When was the study data collected? |

| How was the study data collected? |

| **Dataset Information (Data Screening & Data Cleaning)** |
| Much of the information about data screening in this section comes from the text Using Multivariate Statistics Seventh Edition (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2019). |
| What are the variables in the dataset and the level of measurement for each one? |
